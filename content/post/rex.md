Airlines in Australia are painful. There's expensive (2x price) but nearly full service (Qantas), theres cheap but painful and everything is extra (1x price, Jetstar), theres not so cheap and everything is extra (1.2x, Virgin). But what if I told you there is a 4th option that's both a viable, profitable airline (cya later Bonza), not expensive (1.2x) and lets you bring whatever shape luggage you want, as long as it weighs less than whatever you paid for?
Rex. Rex rules, you should fly Rex. $250 SYD/MEL return with a 23kg oversized bike bag and a big heavy carry on. Amazing, incredible.

### sidenote: australian airports as weworks??
You don't need a ticket to come in, food isn't more expensive than anywhere else (McD's offers still work(!)), it's quiet during the day, you can plane spot, the wifi is free and fast. Only bummer is the train is expensive to Sydney, but you can get the cheap bus from Mascot even. Did I mention you can plane spot? What a win, this is great.

### back to original programming
The train in Sydney doesn't care about big luggage.
The skybus in Melbourne lets you take big luggage too!
Lets see how the trams go.
