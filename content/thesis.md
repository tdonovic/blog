# abstract
Blockchain systems have been used widely to make processes that otherwise required
large amounts of trust (movement of funds, etc.), trustless. Permissioned blockchains
have meant that decentralisation can be applied to an extended set of use cases. Data
quality analysis, a previously centralised process, can now be performed in a decentralised setting. This project implements a decentralised blockchain system to analyse data quality. The system implemented is far slower than a centralised solution.
However, due to itâ€™s nature of being a decentralised solution offers privacy, finality
guarantees, and much lower trust of third parties to use than a centralised solution.
